    <h3>Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death, and shows
        the moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me", and the consternation that this statement caused.</h3>

    <h3> The writer Matteo Bandello observed Leonardo at work and wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint for three or four days at a time.[109] This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the
        convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces of Christ and the traitor Judas, told the duke that he might be obliged to use the prior
        as his model.</h3>

    <h3>The painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterization,[‡ 8] but it deteriorated rapidly, so that within a hundred years it was described by one viewer as "completely ruined."[110] Leonardo, instead of using the reliable technique
        of fresco, had used tempera over a ground that was mainly gesso, resulting in a surface subject to mould and to flaking.[111] Despite this, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various
        mediums. Toward the end of this period, in 1498 da Vinci's trompe-l'œil decoration of the Sala delle Asse was painted for the Duke of Milan in the Castello Sforzesco.</pre>
